# Building a Unix Shell from Scratch in Rust: Lessons Learned from Implementing Push

Over the past several months, I've been working with my team (Youssef Hajjaoui and Zakaria Salhi) on **Push** - a feature-rich Unix-like shell implementation written entirely in Rust. This project has been one of the most educational and challenging endeavors we've undertaken, pushing us to deeply understand systems programming, language design, and the intricate details of how shells actually work under the hood.

## The Vision: Understanding the Foundation

Most developers use shells daily (bash, zsh, fish), but few understand what happens when you type `ls | grep "test"` and press Enter. We wanted to build a shell from scratch to truly understand:
- How command parsing and execution works
- The complexity of process management and job control
- The nuances of variable expansion and quoting
- How pipelines and redirections are implemented
- The challenges of interactive terminal handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, BSD)

### Installation

Install Push using the Makefile:

```bash
make install
```

This will:
- Build the shell and utilities in release mode
- Install them to `~/.push/bin/`
- Create configuration files (`~/.push/.pushrc`, `~/.push/.push_history`)
- Add `~/.push/bin` to your PATH by updating your shell configuration file

After installation, run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
or
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Or simply restart your terminal. Then you can use Push with:
```bash
push
```

**Running Push:**

- **Interactive Mode:** Just run `push`
- **Non-Interactive Mode (from stdin):** `echo "ls -la" | push`
- **Command Mode:** `push -c "ls | grep test"`

## Architecture: A Multi-Stage Pipeline

The shell follows a classic compiler-like architecture with distinct phases:

### 1. Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)

The lexer is a state machine that processes raw input character by character. This was more complex than we initially anticipated. Handling edge cases like:
- Variable substitution: `$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `$((arithmetic))`, `$(command)`
- Quoting: Single quotes (literal), double quotes (variable expansion), and escaping
- Redirection operators: `>`, `>>`, `<`, `<<`, and file descriptor variants like `2>&1`
- Word boundaries: When does a word end? What about `ls>file` vs `ls > file`?

The state machine approach was crucial here. States like `InWord`, `InSingleQuote`, `InDoubleQuote`, `MaybeRedirectOut2` allowed us to handle context-dependent parsing correctly.

### 2. Parsing: Building the Abstract Syntax Tree

The parser constructs an AST representing the shell command structure. This was fascinating because shell syntax is more complex than it appears:
- Operator precedence: `&&` vs `||` vs `;` vs `|`
- Grouping: `{ commands; }` vs `(subshell)`
- Control flow: `if-then-elif-else-fi`, `while-do-done`, `for-in-do-done`
- Function definitions: `name() { body; }`

We implemented a recursive descent parser with lookahead, which made handling operator precedence and nested constructs manageable. The AST nodes (`AstNode` enum) represent everything from simple commands to complex control structures.

### 3. Expansion: The Magic of Variable Substitution

Variable expansion is where shells get their power. Implementing this correctly required understanding:
- When to expand: Variables in double quotes expand, but not in single quotes
- Field splitting: After expansion, words are split on whitespace (unless quoted)
- Arithmetic expansion: `$((2 + 2))` evaluates to `4`
- Command substitution: `$(date)` executes and substitutes output
- Default values: `${VAR:-default}` provides fallback values

The `Word` type stores expansion information, allowing the executor to know whether a word should be split or kept as-is.

### 3.5. Environment Management: The Shell's State

One of the most critical components we implemented was the shell environment. The `ShellEnv` struct manages the complete state of the shell:

- **Shell Variables**: A `HashMap<String, (String, bool)>` storing variable names, values, and whether they're exported to child processes
- **Arithmetic Variables**: Separate storage for numeric variables used in arithmetic expressions
- **User-Defined Functions**: Functions defined with `name() { body; }` syntax, stored as AST nodes
- **Job Control**: Integration with the job management system for tracking background processes
- **Exit Status Tracking**: Maintaining `$?` (last command exit status)
- **Positional Arguments**: Handling `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, etc. for script arguments

The environment initialization (`ShellEnv::new()`) sets up:
- Inherited environment variables from the parent process
- Standard variables: `USER`, `HOME`, `SHELL`, `PWD`
- Special handling for `~` (home directory expansion)
- Positional arguments from command-line invocation

We implemented proper separation between local variables (shell-only) and exported variables (passed to child processes). The `set_local_var()` and `set_env_var()` methods ensure correct scoping and inheritance behavior.

### 4. Execution: Where the Real Work Happens

The execution engine is the heart of the shell. This is where we learned the most about Unix process management:

**Process Creation and Management:**
- Using `fork()` to create child processes (via the `nix` crate)
- `execve()` to replace process image with external commands
- Process groups for job control: `setpgid()` to create/manage groups
- Terminal control: `tcsetpgrp()` to give terminal control to foreground processes

**Pipelines:**
Implementing pipelines was particularly challenging. The key insight: all commands in a pipeline must run concurrently, connected via pipes. The implementation:
1. Creates pipes between consecutive commands
2. Spawns all processes concurrently (not sequentially!)
3. Connects stdin/stdout appropriately
4. Waits for all processes to complete
5. Returns the exit status of the last command

**Job Control:**
Job control allows background execution and process management:
- Background jobs: `command &` runs in background
- Job tracking: Each job has a process group ID (PGID)
- Status tracking: Running, Stopped, Done, Terminated
- Job commands: `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `kill`
- Signal handling: SIGTSTP (Ctrl+Z), SIGINT (Ctrl+C), SIGCONT

The job reaper thread periodically checks for completed child processes using `waitpid()` with `WNOHANG`, preventing zombie processes.

**Redirections:**
I/O redirection required careful file descriptor management:
- `>` redirects stdout (fd 1) to a file
- `>>` appends to a file
- `<` redirects stdin (fd 0) from a file
- `2>&1` redirects stderr to stdout
- File descriptor variants: `2>file`, `1>&2`

The redirection system merges redirects from commands and groups, ensuring proper ordering and precedence.

### 5. Interactive Terminal Handling

Building an interactive shell required raw terminal mode:
- **Raw mode**: Disable line buffering and echo for full control
- **Line editing**: Insert, delete, cursor movement
- **History navigation**: Up/Down arrows to browse command history
- **Signal handling**: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+L (clear screen)
- **Prompt display**: Dynamic prompt with proper cursor positioning

Using the `termion` crate, we implemented a readline-like interface with proper cursor tracking and history management. The history persists to a file for future sessions.

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Process Group Management

One of the trickiest aspects was understanding process groups. When you run `ls | grep test`, both processes must be in the same process group so signals (like Ctrl+C) affect both. The first process becomes the group leader, and subsequent processes join that group.

### 2. Terminal Control Transfer

When a foreground process runs, the shell must:
1. Give terminal control to the process group (`tcsetpgrp`)
2. Temporarily ignore SIGTTOU (to avoid blocking)
3. Wait for the process to complete
4. Reclaim terminal control

This dance ensures proper signal delivery and terminal behavior.

### 3. Pipeline Execution Order

Pipelines must execute all commands concurrently, not sequentially. This means:
- All `fork()` calls happen before any `wait()`
- Pipes are created before spawning processes
- File descriptors are properly closed in parent and child
- The shell waits for the entire pipeline, not individual commands

### 4. Variable Expansion Edge Cases

Handling variable expansion correctly required careful attention to:
- Quoting: `"$VAR"` expands, `'$VAR'` doesn't
- Field splitting: `VAR="a b"` splits into two arguments when unquoted
- Empty variables: `""` vs unset variables
- Special variables: `$?` (exit status), `$0` (positional arguments), `$$` (PID)

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery

Rust's `Result<T, E>` type was invaluable for error handling. The `ShellError` enum captures:
- Syntax errors: Unclosed quotes, unexpected tokens
- Parse errors: Invalid command structure
- Execution errors: Command not found, permission denied
- IO errors: File operations, pipe creation

Proper error propagation ensures the shell can recover gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

## Rust-Specific Insights

Building this in Rust provided unique advantages and challenges:

**Advantages:**
- **Memory safety**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or data races
- **Pattern matching**: Exhaustive matching on enums caught many bugs at compile time
- **Ownership system**: Made it clear who owns file descriptors, processes, etc.
- **Error handling**: `Result` types forced explicit error handling
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: The abstractions compile away, leaving efficient code

**Challenges:**
- **Lifetime management**: Ensuring file descriptors and process handles live long enough
- **String handling**: Rust's string types required careful conversion between `&str`, `String`, and `OsString`
- **separation of concerns**: Separate between lexer job and parser job

## Features Implemented

The shell supports a comprehensive set of features, all tested and verified:

### Built-in Commands ✅
- **File operations**: `ls`, `cat`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv`, `mkdir`
- **Navigation**: `cd`, `pwd`
- **Utilities**: `echo`, `export`, `type`, `test`, `true`, `false`

- **Pipelines with control structures**: Pipelines can only contain commands, not if/for/while inside them
- **Redirection to non-existent directories**: Requires parent directory to exist first

## What We Learned

This project taught us:

1. **Systems Programming**: Deep understanding of Unix process model, signals, file descriptors, and terminal I/O
2. **Language Design**: How shell syntax evolved and why certain design decisions were made
3. **Compiler Techniques**: Lexing, parsing, AST construction, and interpretation
4. **Concurrency**: Process management, job control, and signal handling

### Test Results Summary

Based on extensive testing (40+ test scenarios):
- **75% of features fully working** (30/40 tests passed completely)
- **20% partially working** (8/40 tests with minor limitations)
- **5% not yet implemented** (2/40 tests - subshells and some edge cases)

The shell successfully handles:
- All basic built-in commands
- Complex command sequences (8+ commands)
- Multi-stage pipelines
- All logical operator combinations
- Complete if-then-elif-else-fi structures
- For, while, and until loops
- Break and continue with levels
- Full function implementation with arguments
- Variable expansion and environment management
- Command grouping and complex combinations

While it's not a complete replacement for bash or zsh (some advanced features like subshells and command substitution are still in development), we've built a solid, well-tested foundation that demonstrates deep systems programming knowledge and Rust expertise. The core functionality is robust and handles most day-to-day shell operations effectively. The architecture is well-designed and extensible, making it ready for further development.

## Reflection

Building a shell from scratch is one of those projects that seems simple until you start implementing it. The devil is truly in the details: handling edge cases in parsing, managing process lifecycles correctly, ensuring proper signal delivery, and providing a smooth interactive experience.

This project has been invaluable for our growth as systems programmers. Working as a team, we divided responsibilities while maintaining close collaboration. We implemented the complete shell environment system together, ensuring proper variable scoping, function storage, and job tracking. The collaborative effort forced us to understand not just *how* shells work, but *why* they work the way they do. Every feature we implemented revealed new layers of complexity and taught us something new about Unix, Rust, and software engineering in general.

If you're interested in systems programming, language implementation, or just want to understand how the tools you use daily actually work, I highly recommend building a shell. It's challenging, educational, and deeply satisfying.
